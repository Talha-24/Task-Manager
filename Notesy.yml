## React Router DOM:
 Offers client and server side routing
 ## SPA:
 Single page applications are those applications in which 
 content is rendered dynamically without reloading the page.

# Benefits:
 Content is rendered dynamically without reloading the page

# Terms:
 Browser Router : container which wraps the application. Make sure to rendered a specific component based on the url
 Routes : container of route items, make sure to render the component at specific path.
 Route : has path and element prop, it maps the specific react component with specific path. When mapped, that component is displayed.

 Link: Opposite to anchor tag, <Link to ="/">Home ></Link>  navgiates to specific path without relaoding the page
 NavLink: Works like Link tag, but hightlights the activated route <NavLink to="/" className="active-route" >Home</NavLink>

 # Nested Routing:
 <Routes>
  <Route path"/dashboard" element={<Dashboard/>}>  /dashboard
        <Route path="setting" element={<Setting/>  /dashboard/setting 
        <Route path="home" element={<Home/>        /dashboard/home   
        }
  </Route>
 </Routes> 

 # Dynamic Routing:

 <Route path="/user/:id" element={<UserDetails/>} />
 id is send to this route 
 that id is fetched throughout the userParams Hooks, and user specific data is fetched..
